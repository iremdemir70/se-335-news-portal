# Assumptions and Additional Notes

- Authors Section: A "Authors" slider was implemented to simulate a real-world news portal experience where popular columnists are featured.
- Don't Miss Section: A separate curated content section ("Don't Miss") was added to showcase key highlights or editor picks.
- These sections were not part of the original requirements but were added as extra features to enhance user experience.

- Responsiveness: The layout has been tested for responsiveness across different screen sizes, ensuring mobile and desktop compatibility.
